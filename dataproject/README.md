# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data project - antidepressants** and is about Antidepressant use divided into age groups and educational levels. We are spesifically looking at the drug group psycholeptics which contains some types of antidepressants. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb) and we find that in general the older people are the more they use psycholeptics, but that the development of use is negative for older pople and positive for younger people (when generelazing the results). we also find that people that have only completed a primary school education or unspecified education have the higest use of psycholeptics compared to the other education levels while people with long higher education have the lovest use. 

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. MEDICIN4 (statistikbanken.dk) 
1. MEDICIN3 (statistikbanken.dk)
1. HFUDD11 (statistikbanken.dk)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
