# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **OLG model with population growth** and is about an Overlapping generations model with two types of agents (young and old) with an increase in population each period correponding to the size of the parameter n.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb) and overall we find a steady state level of capital which is negativly affected by the discounting parameter rho and the capital weight in the production function alpha as well as the population growth parameter n.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
