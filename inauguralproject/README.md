# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb) we find that the model given in the project dosn't fit the data very vell (unless women are a lot more productive in the home than men), but if men and women have different levels of disulility of working we can make the model fit the data a lot more nicely.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
